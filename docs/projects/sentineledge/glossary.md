# SentinelEdge Endpoint Security – Glossary of Security Terms

## Objective

# 

This glossary provides clear, simple definitions for security and technical terms used throughout the SentinelEdge documentation. Its goal is to ensure that all users, regardless of their cybersecurity background, can understand the concepts and features of the product.

## Intended Audience

# 

*   **Non-Security Readers:** To bridge the gap between general IT knowledge and security-specific language.
    
*   **New Users:** To help them get up to speed with SentinelEdge-specific terminology and common industry jargon.

## Common Security Terms

# | Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Endpoint | Any device connected to a network, such as a laptop, desktop, server, or mobile phone. |
| Malware | Short for "malicious software." It is any program or file designed to harm, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a computer. |
| Ransomware | A type of malware that locks or encrypts your files, with attackers demanding a ransom payment to unlock them. |
| Vulnerability | A weakness or "hole" in software or a system that an attacker can exploit to gain access or cause harm. |
| Exploit | A specific method or piece of code used by attackers to take advantage of a vulnerability. |
| Zero-Day | A vulnerability or threat that is brand new and unknown to the software vendor, meaning there is "zero days" of protection available yet. |
| False Positive | When a security tool incorrectly identifies a safe file or activity as a threat. |
| Privilege Escalation | An attack where a user with low-level access (like a guest) manages to gain high-level permissions (like an administrator). |

## Product-Specific Terminology

# | Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Behavior-Based Monitoring | A SentinelEdge feature that looks at what a program is doing (its behavior) rather than what it looks like to catch new or unknown threats. |
| Agent | The small piece of SentinelEdge software installed on an endpoint that performs the actual monitoring and protection. |
| Management Console | The central website or "command center" where administrators can see the status of all protected devices and change settings. |
| Security Policy | A set of rules created by an administrator that tells the SentinelEdge agents what to block, what to ignore, and how to report threats. |
| Isolation | A response action where SentinelEdge cuts off a device's network connection to prevent a threat from spreading, while still allowing it to talk to the management console. |
| Exclusion | A setting that tells SentinelEdge to ignore a specific file or folder, usually to prevent a legitimate program from being accidentally blocked (a false positive). |
| Tamper Protection | A built-in shield that prevents unauthorized users or malware from turning off or deleting the SentinelEdge agent. |
